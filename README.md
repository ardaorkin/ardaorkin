I love designing, creating, coding useful applications.

At the beginning of my tech career, I started as a Linux system administrator. In time, I realized that software development is highly attractive to me. Therefore I chose to make a good career in software development. 

I educated myself, took courses, created side-projects, followed people who have very powerful skills and years of experience in software development, read articles and watch video series. Throughout this process, I realized one thing that the key to targeting having a good career in software development is to keep learning and never give up when problems or life getting harsh. 

This challenging behavior of software development is fascinating to me. So I keep learning and try to get more and more knowledge and ability in software development and I am glad to say that I get rewarded with every step I take.
